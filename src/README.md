# Z2Dmp
This is a port of [z2dmp](https://github.com/comaeio/z2dmp) which was originally written in C++. As we are moving to a more cross platform and interoperable architecture, this has been rewritten in Rust.

`.zdmp` files are compressed Microsoft full memory crash dump files generated by DumpIt driver. The compression layer is our own flavor which is why it is open-source.

The reason for a simple format is because it is handle by DumpIt kernel driver.

## Usage
```
z2dmp <input_file> <output_file>
```
